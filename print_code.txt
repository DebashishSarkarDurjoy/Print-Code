There’s an ancient but useful command line utility for this, called enscript.

On MacOS, you’ll need to brew install enscript first.

On Linux, you may already have it. If not, look for the package enscript or download it here.

To print your code, run:

enscript -1rG --line-numbers -p out.ps --highlight=python \
  -c inputfile.py

Then you can either open out.ps (on MacOS to open in your default PostScript viewer), or print it to your default printer with lpr out.ps.

Enscript has a lot of options. Here are the most valuable options:

-1 -2 -3 -4 number of columns per page
-r rotate (landscape mode)
-G fancy header (with filename, date & time)
--color=1 if you have a color printer
-w html if you want HTML output instead of PostScript
--help-highlight will show which languages have syntax highlighting available

Here’s a nice looking version that adds--color=1 and -2. If your line lengths aren’t out of control, this is a good starting point.

enscript -2rG --line-numbers -p out.ps --highlight=python \
  --color=1 -c inputfile.py
